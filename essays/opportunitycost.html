      i've realised great people think about time, money or work in terms of opportunity cost. "what's the next best way to spend __?". i've been trying to think like that too. for all decisions of life: relationship, career, routine or health decisions. you're given choices.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      <em>choices → dilemmas → decisions. the usual cycle. sometimes they are visible (impactful decisions), sometimes they're not (low-impact)</em>
    </p>
    
    <p >
      be it your current routine, starting a new business, choosing b/w jobs, investing in a stock, or that splitwise balance that has never been cleared. all of these cost you something. <em>all could've been something</em>. all have a 100 '<em>if i do this</em>' scenarios associated to themselves.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      annoying part about choices is that they create distraction: <em>they make it hard for you to stick to that one skill, habit, job or asset, & let it compound over time</em>. choices are compounding's biggest enemies. the 21st century (so far) has it the worst.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      it sucks, but all decisions can be simplified by using oc. e.g.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      • if taking a sabbatical is more imp than 3 months of salary, do it.<br>
      • if 2Y of work matters more than a 2Y degree; don't do that MBA..
    </p>
    
    <p >
      there's no definitive science, though. these are just ways to increase efficiency. but efficiency isn't everything. a lot of choices that have led civilisation to where it is, weren't efficient bets. proving that OC, as a standalone, doesn't guarantee result. it's all guess work. <strong>sometimes serendipity can take you places efficiency can't.</strong>
