    <h1 class="title" >the pursuit of intentionality</h1>
    <p class="date" >01 Feb, 2024</p>
    
    <p >
      for first 10 years of life, we should spend maximum time & money on understanding self, markets, people & the world around. select the handful of beliefs, people & battles you want to fight, a little more intentionally.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      don't ease the continuous yearn to discover the intersection of what you're good at --> what we love --> & being in it's top %ile.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      have a macro-cosmic perspective towards decisions you take. fucking around & finding out is a horrible strategy <em>if you don't self reflect aggressively & iterate</em>. chasing variety can often curse you with shallow insights & results. across a broad spectrum, the best people i know, have intentionally spent hours self reflecting, chasing depth, iterating & finding joy. they often:
    </p>
    
    <p >
      a) try a lot of things (for more than 3 months, minimum) b) have a clear why (to help stay consistent) c) eliminate what they don't enjoy d) spend the next 5 yrs becoming great at what they end up enjoying
    </p>
    
    <p >
      step 2 is hard, but having a why helps you commit for 10 yrs. it's hard when you don't have a convincing reason to show up each day. being content has an eerily high co-relation with what occupies your brain for 12 hrs every day. that's half your life.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      and when we do arrive on step 4, most of us will never be good at what we like at first - actions & results will build confidence. there's a reason why the cliche "action > words", is a <em>cliche</em>. we will always look stupid when we try something new. no matter how good you're at X, you're going to suck ass at Y (more often than not)
    </p>
    
    <p >
      and that, is how you bring naval's "The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life" to reality
