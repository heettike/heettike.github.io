      hi. the past quarter has been chaotic; we had been house hunting for 4 months to no avail, partly bcs we were going through a company shut-down - confusion - trying 4 things - new company begins & although revenue started on day 1, we couldn't access monies till day. also, we were caught in this trap of finding the 'ticks all items' house. a small revelation has been that almost nothing ever ticks all items.
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
      <em>you do the best you can with what you have.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
      i've surfed couches every now & then, but never for like 4 months straight; this time i went from being an amateur to a full-fledged professional. i occupied 8 unique beds (for a week min) in 5 diff. houses across 2 cities.
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">
      i've either forgotten, or purposely left something in <em>each of these houses</em> for one reason or the other ‚Äì. i've ordered a shower gel 6 times in 4 months & a towel thrice. i've likely had 3 swiggy/instamart orders a day <em>on average</em>; made peace w/ living out of a suitcase
    </p>

      you will have no personal space.<br>
      your clothes will be mostly dirty/crumpled.<br>
      you'll be wondering where some of your things are.<br>
      you will get hit by your friends' elbow while you're üò¥üí§üò¥.<br>
      your 'food choices' will go for a toss.<br>
      you will have to express gratitude, irrespective of how you must feel.<br>
      your select few possessions will either rot in a storage room somewhere, or will have to fit in that 26x18 suitcase of yours.<br>
      you will feel you don't <em>belong anywhere</em>.<br>
      you will need to put up w/ a smile anyway.
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 0.9s;">
      if push comes to shove & you find yourself in the same spot as yours truly, here's..<em>how you could be a better couch surfer</em>
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 1.0s;">
      - make yourself scarce every once in a while [read: once every couple days]<br>
      - don't act entitled<br>
      - sincerely ask them to let you chip in for all costs <em>excl. rent, mostly</em><br>
      - you have to respect the owner's pet peeves. it's hard to be mindful ‚Äî but it's a non-negotiable<br>
      - give gifts - treats - pay bills that are ~ 25 to 30% the rent amount; nobody likes an ungrateful free loader<br>
      - wherever you're staying pay their house help/cook/guard bhaiya 500/1000 on day 1. they might treat you well<br>
      - don't ever leave a mess behind (in community areas) ~ your shoes, laptop etc, books, post meal stuff<br>
      - have shoe bags, sanitary kits, a good backpack & 1 suitcase that can fit stuff. (ideally i'd recommend to go leaner)<br>
      - whether you like to be clean or not ‚Äì you de-facto mode <em>HAS</em> to be ultra-clean [i sucked balls, but eventually got better]
    </p>
    
    <p style="animation-delay: 1.1s;">
      there's a thrill to doing all this ‚Äì but wouldn't be possible w/o my friends who put up w/ me all through. ya'll know who you are - i'm incredibly grateful.
    </p>
