      <li>it's only a character in your life, but we all put it at the centre.</li>
      <li>money buys time, and you sell your time for money.</li>
      <li>if you aren't rich, you aren't smart.</li>
      <li>it is the only resource available in abundance, everything else, from energy & fuel to love & trust, is far more scarce.</li>
      <li>$1M is when you enter the rookie league.</li>
      <li>it worries you the most while it's the most solvable piece of the puzzle.</li>
      <li>residents of each street of delhi, bombay, blr, ggn, pune likely have a combined net-worth above 50cr. minimum.</li>
      <li>you're peeling off layer1 to the onion of life when you solve for money.</li>
      <li>the more desperate you are, the lesser you will get, it's the backwards law. (only applies if you're privileged)</li>
      <li>act as poor as you can.</li>
      <li>invest & save.</li>
      <li>buy experiences, not materialistic-good-for-nothing-novelty-chasing goods.</li>
      <li>money is best spent on your loved ones, nothing trumps that.</li>
      <li>money based milestones are moving goal-posts.</li>
      <li>money is a maze, it is built to suck you in & it will toy with you all your life.</li>
      <li>ask your friends for money, return when need be.</li>
      <li>help your friends with money, it's the cheapest & the easiest thing you can give to them.</li>
      <li>too many relationships are f*cked over money, and it's never worth it.</li>
      <li>we're conditioned to use it as the common unit of comparing success, because it's not the best, but the most convenient way to quantify success.</li>
      <li>it's a ticket to freedom, doing what you love & spending time with self, friends & family.</li>
      <li>people who continuously boast about how much they make/have made are losers.</li>
      <li>if you're aimless with your purpose, solve for money as early as you can. use the money to find the rest of the answers.</li>
      <li>leverage & status are by-products of money, and it fast-track almost everything.</li>
      <li>be rich & anonymous.</li>
      <li>there are no get rich quick schemes.</li>
      <li>don't be greedy, you might make a lot, but you'll lose a lot more</li>
      <li>don't dupe anyone, cheat anyone - the consequences will make you regret your decisions forever. even if it's a dollar.</li>
