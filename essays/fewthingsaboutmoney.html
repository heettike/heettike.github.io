      1. it's only a character in your life, but we all put it at the centre.<br>
      2. money buys time, and you sell your time for money.<br>
      3. if you aren't rich, you aren't smart.<br>
      4. it is the only resource available in abundance, everything else, from energy & fuel to love & trust, is far more scarce.<br>
      5. $1M is when you enter the rookie league.<br>
      6. it worries you the most while it's the most solvable piece of the puzzle.<br>
      7. residents of each street of delhi, bombay, blr, ggn, pune likely have a combined net-worth above 50cr. minimum.<br>
      8. you're peeling off layer1 to the onion of life when you solve for money.<br>
      9. the more desperate you are, the lesser you will get, it's the backwards law. (only applies if you're privileged)<br>
      10. act as poor as you can.<br>
      11. invest & save.<br>
      12. buy experiences, not materialistic-good-for-nothing-novelty-chasing goods.<br>
      13. money is best spent on your loved ones, nothing trumps that.<br>
      14. money based milestones are moving goal-posts.<br>
      15. money is a maze, it is built to suck you in & it will toy with you all your life.<br>
      16. ask your friends for money, return when need be.<br>
      17. help your friends with money, it's the cheapest & the easiest thing you can give to them.<br>
      18. too many relationships are f*cked over money, and it's never worth it.<br>
      19. we're conditioned to use it as the common unit of comparing success, because it's not the best, but the most convenient way to quantify success.<br>
      20. it's a ticket to freedom, doing what you love & spending time with self, friends & family.<br>
      21. people who continuously boast about how much they make/have made are losers.<br>
      22. if you're aimless with your purpose, solve for money as early as you can. use the money to find the rest of the answers.<br>
      23. leverage & status are by-products of money, and it fast-track almost everything.<br>
      24. be rich & anonymous.<br>
      25. there are no get rich quick schemes.<br>
      26. don't be greedy, you might make a lot, but you'll lose a lot more<br>
      27. don't dupe anyone, cheat anyone - the consequences will make you regret your decisions forever. even if it's a dollar.
