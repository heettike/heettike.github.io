      95% of the reels suck. most of the creators out there are ass. to me, they are spineless. standard fu*kin templates to get views, likes and vanity. doing it for all the wrong reasons known to mankind.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      literature, text, videos, music, paintings, sculptures were mediums created to <em>express</em>, while the mediums have evolved over time, the critical mass of content today is created for the wrong reasons. i despise the 'optimising my content' fodder people feed to themselves & others. man, just express. that's the muscle you want to actually exercise for the next few decades. a raw, natural, and a <em>real</em> way of being.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      create art, not 'content'. stop that consistency bs & add character to your expression. make your art, a reflection of who you are, painting a floozy picture of yourself to get fame & $$'s is a1, but you lose out on character & individuality. not sitting behind a mic yapping with 11 infographics running just like 23421 creators out there. stop trying to game the algorithm in entirety & create to express.
