      engineers, leaders, innovators & artists have existed for centuries. all 4 kinds tend to do repeat the same skill day in, day out for decades to get where they dreamt to be! there's a lot of nuance to the art of practicing any of it.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      a starting point could be to help high alpha people in your life solve their biggest problem today. like.. a side project.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      treat their headaches like you'd treat yours! take charge to solve it. start with check-ins, discussions, quick actionables, connects - anyway you could treat the headache.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      in process.. you'll build trust - the rarest currency that floats in the market today. trust. this is just one way to earn it. trust, just like money, compounds too; it increases your surface area to <em>get lucky & win</em>. so i've learnt that's a good thing to work on. relationships. (they also get you some fun stories for the road when you're old one day.)
    </p>
    
    <p >
      the real ask from you is whether you can: offer to help. helping when asked is expected most often. <em>(the 'transactional' mindset should go straight into the bin)</em>. if that's how it ends, it's ok. but idea is to do more. i have an abundance mindset, i think there's more for everyone; the world around is is extremely far from efficiency. <em>from nash-equillibrium</em>. if you can help increase their income, happiness or aspirations -- just do it.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      open your network. help them get a job, business, an opportunity. you can choose to heavy lift till the problem is solved if you're enjoying/learning through it all.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      this can be practiced <em>effectively</em> when you aren't obsessed with a problem to solve yourself. when you're looking for inspiration & novelty beyond the routine you're engineered to, you're in the right spot to do what i ask of you.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      you gain: NPS, indispensability, & <em>your right to ask</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p >
      money is a by-product of trust. you will earn money through this process one way or the other. <em>just don't do it for the money</em>.
